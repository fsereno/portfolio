# Random Generator

With this application I have built a random generator using TypeScript, Pug and Sass.

### Explanation ###

The interest in this application was to demonstrate use of TypeScript in a distributed services application, with dependancies being injected from a single, top level application entry point.

This application highlighted areas of interest around depencancy management with TypeScript. This is something I will be looking into in following applications.

Run the application from within the route directory, using the master Gulp file and the default Gulp task.
```
    cd ../../
    gulp
```
