# Welcome

## The 3D Introduction

The Home application serves as the entry point to my Portfolio. It showcases an interactive 3D scene utilising Three.js and demonstrates my understanding of programming complex 3D applications.

A physics engine, Connon.js, has been incorporated to enable collision detection and simulate forces like gravity.

I've added texture mapping and written a number of 'randomness' generators to ensure a unique experience with each load. The particles constantly evolve in the background.

## The Applications

Below the introduction, you will find a collection of applications available for demonstration within the Portfolio. The search bar allows you to filter through the applications. Additionally, there is a search bar in the top navigation available on every page.

This portfolio showcases a minimum viable product (MVP) for a technology-agnostic cloud deployment solution.

I hope you enjoy exploring and feel free to view the code on GitHub or contact me with any queries.
