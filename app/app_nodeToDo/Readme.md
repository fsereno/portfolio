# NodeJS, To-Do List SPA

With this application, I have extended previous To-Do concepts. This application is driven by Node.js and Express and is authenticated using JWT tokens.

Please note that data is only stored in memory for the purpose of this example. I may use MongoDB or a similar solution in the near future.

The frontend is built with React and React Router. State is managed using a combination of React Context and the Context Provider Pattern.
