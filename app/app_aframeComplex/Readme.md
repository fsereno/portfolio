# AFrame React (Complex)

With this application I have continued the simple 'Hello World' AFrame application, coupled with React as a means of managing state. This application now allows for user input via the users cursor.

### Explanation ###

This is the next in a series of applications experimenting with WebXR.

This is a progression of this stack, with the focus now on simple user input while in a WebXR application.

I have used Webpack to bundle JS dependancies and Babel to transpile to the correct ES version.

This application is intended for use in any modern WebXR enabled web browser or headset.

Now supporting 6 degrees of freedom, however the only controller supported is the users cursor.
