# Natural Sorting Algorithm

With this application I have built a natural string sorting algorithm, using .NET.

A basic React user interface handles user input and application state.

With this application I have implemented IComparer to handle the sorting logic, comparing chunks of alpha and numeric values in order to achieve a natural sort order.

Whilst this functionality could be achieved with JavaScript alone, I wanted to demonstrate knowledge of IComparer and 
.NET.

A lot of research was undertaken for this application, with many permutations in order to overcome this simple, yet complex task. Made for a very enjoyable project!
