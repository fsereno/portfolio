# To-Do React Redux

With this application I have extended the simple To-Do list using React to now use Redux to handle the application state, implementing native Undo and Redo functionality.

### Explanation ###

I have used Webpack to bundle JS dependancies and Babel to transpile to the correct ES version.

The interest in this application is to continue exploring how React can be used for 2 way data binding between the DOM and application state. But with this application I have also introduced the use of Redux to help with implementing 'undo' functionality and the handling on immutable application state.
