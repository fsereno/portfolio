# Knockout TypeScript Application

With this application I have built a simple Knockout application, coupled with TypeScript.

### Explanation ###

The interest in this application was to demonstrate use of TypeScript in a distributed services application, with dependancies being injected from a single, top level application entry point.

This application highlighted areas of interest around depencancy management with TypeScript. This is something I will be looking into in following applications.

I was also interested to see how I could improve the use of KO with the strict approach possible with TypeScript.

Run the application from within the route directory, using the master Gulp file and the default Gulp task.
```
    cd ../../
    gulp
```
