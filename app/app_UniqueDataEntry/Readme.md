# Unique Data Entry Application

With this application I have built a unique data entry form. A simple React frontend handles the UI and data entry logic is dealt with by .NET and IEqualityComparer.

Whilst this functionality could be achieved with JavaScript alone, I wanted to demonstrate knowledge of IEqualityComparer and the .NET framework.
