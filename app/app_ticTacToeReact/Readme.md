# Tic-Tac-Toe React

With this application I have followed the Tic-Tac-Toe React example tutorial, with the aim of understanding application state and how immutability can be handled within React.

### Explanation ###

I have used Webpack to bundle JS dependancies and Babel to transpile to the correct ES version.

The interest in this application is to explore conventions and methods that are being promoted as standards for React. The application covers many core React features and key paradigms. In particular my interest is in the handling of 'undo' functionality using React.
