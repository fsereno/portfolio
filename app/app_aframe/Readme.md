# AFrame React (Basic)

With this application I have built a simple 'Hello World' AFrame application, coupled with React as a means of managing state.

### Explanation ###

I have used Webpack to bundle JS dependancies and Babel to transpile to the correct ES version.

The interest in this application is to explore WebXR prototyping using AFrame, with the aim of allowing user input via React in a follow up application.

This application is intended for use in any modern WebXR enabled web browser or headset.

This is one in a series of applications experimenting with WebXR. Currently only supporting 3 degrees of freedom and no controller input.
