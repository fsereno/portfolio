# AFrame React Basic

With this application I have built a simple 'Hello World' AFrame application, coupled with React as a means of managing state.

### Technology stack used ###

I have used Webpack to bundle JS dependancies and Babel to transpile to the correct ES version.

The interest in this stack is to allow for quick, deployable, WebXR prototyping using AFrame, with the aim of allowing user input via React in a follow up application. This is one in a series of applications experimenting with WebXR. Currently only supporting 3 degrees of freedom and not controller input.

### Project commands ###

Build JavaScript by running the default Gulp task from within this directory
```
    gulp
```

Run the application from within the route directory, using the master Gulp file and the default Gulp task
```
    cd ../../
    gulp
```
