# Three JS Scene (Basic)

With this application I have built a simple 'Hello World' Three JS application.

### Explanation ###

I have used Webpack to bundle JS dependancies and Babel to transpile to the correct ES version.

The interest in this application is to explore the power of Three JS for building web friendly, 3D graphics applications using WebGL. Hover of a cube to trigger an animation.

This application is intended for use in any modern web browsers.

This is one in a series of applications experimenting with WebGL and WebXR.

### Project commands ###

Build JavaScript by running the default Gulp task from within this directory
```
    gulp
```

Run the application from within the route directory, using the master Gulp file and the default Gulp task
```
    cd ../../
    gulp
```
