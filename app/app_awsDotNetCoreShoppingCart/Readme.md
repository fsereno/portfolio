# ASP.NET Core Web API Serverless Application with React Interface

A simple shopping basket application, with a React frontend and user input data being processed via .Net Core running on AWS.

This project shows how to run an ASP.NET Core Web API project as an AWS Lambda exposed through Amazon API Gateway. The NuGet package [Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer) contains a Lambda function that is used to translate requests from API Gateway into the ASP.NET Core framework and then the responses from ASP.NET Core back to API Gateway.

### Configuring for API Gateway HTTP API ###

API Gateway supports the original REST API and the new HTTP API. In addition HTTP API supports 2 different
payload formats. When using the 2.0 format the base class of `LambdaEntryPoint` must be `Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer.APIGatewayHttpApiV2ProxyFunction`.
For the 1.0 payload format the base class is the same as REST API which is `Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer.APIGatewayProxyFunction`.
**Note:** when using the `AWS::Serverless::Function` CloudFormation resource with an event type of `HttpApi` the default payload
format is 2.0 so the base class of `LambdaEntryPoint` must be `Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer.APIGatewayHttpApiV2ProxyFunction`.

### Project Files ###

* serverless.template - an AWS CloudFormation Serverless Application Model template file for declaring your Serverless functions and other AWS resources
* aws-lambda-tools-defaults.json - default argument settings for use with Visual Studio and command line deployment tools for AWS
* LambdaEntryPoint.cs - class that derives from **Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer.APIGatewayProxyFunction**. The code in
this file bootstraps the ASP.NET Core hosting framework. The Lambda function is defined in the base class.
Change the base class to **Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer.ApplicationLoadBalancerFunction** when using an
Application Load Balancer.
* LocalEntryPoint.cs - for local development this contains the executable Main function which bootstraps the ASP.NET Core hosting framework with Kestrel, as for typical ASP.NET Core applications.
* Startup.cs - usual ASP.NET Core Startup class used to configure the services ASP.NET Core will use.
* web.config - used for local development.
* Controllers\S3ProxyController - Web API controller for proxying an S3 bucket
* Controllers\ValuesController - example Web API controller
