      | Think about how a cup of coffee is made.
      | Typically tasks are carried out while the kettle is boiling.
      | Why wait for a process to complete, when it could be run as a background task ?
    h2 How ?
    p 
      | Technically, when calling the Sync method, a series of actions are run in order of
      | execution, synchronously. With each action completing before the next is run.
      | When calling the Async method, however async / await are being used, spawning
      | a State Machine object, with Task acting as the interface between code and state.
      | The threadpool is free to use new threads if needed and return execution instead
      | of blocking execution as with a synchronous program.
    p
      | Run the process of making a cup of coffee both synchronously and asynchronously.
      | Notice the difference in the order of tasks ?
