# AFrame React (Complex)

With this application I have built a simple To-Do list using React to handle user input and manage state.

### Explanation ###

I have used Webpack to bundle JS dependancies and Babel to transpile to the correct ES version.

The interest in this stack is to explore how React can be used for 2 way binding of view and application state. With a particular interest in Reacts use of a virtual DOM.

### Project commands ###

Build JavaScript by running the default Gulp task from within this directory
```
    gulp
```

Run the application from within the route directory, using the master Gulp file and the default Gulp task
```
    cd ../../
    gulp
```
