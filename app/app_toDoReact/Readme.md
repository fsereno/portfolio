# To-Do React

With this application I have built a simple To-Do list using React to handle user input and manage state.

### Explanation ###

I have used Webpack to bundle JS dependancies and Babel to transpile to the correct ES version.

The interest in this application is to explore how React can be used for 2 way data binding between the DOM and application state. With a particular interest in Reacts use of a virtual DOM.
