# Azure Functions, .NET Core, Data Structures Api

With this application I am demonstrating knowledge of data structures, Queue and Stack. With Queue being first in, first out and Stack being last in, first out.

### Explanation ###

Using Generics in .NET I have implemented an interface, which acts as the contract to allow for a polymorphic nature when instructing the Queue and Stack structures to add and remove items.

- Stack in .NET (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.stack?view=net-5.0)

- Generics (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/generics/)
