# ToDo (Basic)

With this application I have built a primitive To-Do list using only JQuery and TypeScript.

### Explanation ###

The purpose of this application is to highlight areas of improvement that can be addressed with the likes of React or Vue JS.

Other areas of interest highlighted by this application are regarding dependancy management for JavaScript and transpilation for older browsers. Currently I am using Babel to help not only compile TypeScript but also lower the ES version for older browsers.

### Project commands ###

Build JavaScript by running the default Gulp task from within this directory
```
    gulp
```

Run the application from within the route directory, using the master Gulp file and the default Gulp task
```
    cd ../../
    gulp
```
