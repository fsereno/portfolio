# .NET, Complex Entity Sorting Algorithm

With this application I have built a complex type sorting interface, using .NET. A basic React user interface handles user input and application state.

Whilst this functionality could be achieved with JavaScript alone, I wanted to demonstrate knowledge of two key .NET interfaces: ICompareable and IComparer.

- ICompareable (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.icomparable?view=netcore-3.1)

- IComparer (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.icomparer?view=netcore-3.1)
