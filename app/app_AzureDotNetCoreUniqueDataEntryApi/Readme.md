# Azure Functions, .NET Core, Unique Data Entry Api

With this application I have built a unique data entry form. A simple React frontend handles the UI and data entry logic is dealt with by .NET Core and IEqualityComparer.

Whilst this functionality could be achieved with JavaScript alone, I wanted to demonstrate knowledge of IEqualityComparer and the .NET Core framework. I also wanted to explore Azure Functions and the power of serverless compute.
