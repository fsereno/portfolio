## Prerequisites

- NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/)
---

## Installation

- Follow these steps to install this repo locally.
---

### Clone

- Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/fsereno/portfolio`
---

### Compose

- Please ensure you have Docker installed and running.
- Open your preferred command line:

Docker compose files are dynamically built, depending on command line arguments.

```shell
$ npm run compose -- <options>
```
Passing no arguments will result in adding all available services to the production compose file.

Alternatively, passing --dev will build the development compose file.

```shell
$ npm run compose -- --dev
```

However, once again, this will include all available services in the compose file.

To include only specific services in the compose file, use the --include argument:

```shell
$ npm run compose -- --include dataStructures --dev
```
##### This will:
- Compose the development version of the file.
- Simply exclude --dev if building for production.
- Include only the dataStructures service.
- The necessary Nginx service will also be included.

### Start/Stop

- Please ensure you have Docker installed and running.
- Open your preferred command line:

```shell
$ npm run start -- <options>
```
Passing no arguments will result in the production environment being started.

##### This will:
- Pull all images from Docker Hub.
- Spin up all services in containers.
- The application will be available at: http://localhost

To stop one of the above tasks, excluding those which destroy themselves (create, test)

```shell
$ npm run stop -- <options>
```
---

```shell
$ npm run start  -- --dev
```
##### This will:
- Start the webpack development server.
- Start the necessary backend services.
- Watch for any changes on development resources.
- Hot-reload any changes straight to the browser.
- The default application is the root application - home
- Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost
---

#### Run dependency analysis on a specific application

```shell
$ npm run start -- --name home --analysis HOW TO DO ANOTHER APP ?
```
##### This will:
- Start the analysis server.
- Perform a dependency analysis of the application.
- Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost
---

#### Build for release

```shell
$ npm run release
```
##### This will:
- Build the production static assets directory (dist or docs, depending on the configuration).
---

#### Run all unit tests

```shell
$ npm run test
```
##### This will:
- Run all application specific and global unit tests.
---

#### Run all functional end-to-end tests

```shell
$ npm run test-apps-e2e
```
##### This will:
- Run all functional tests from the ./app/tests/functional directory
- Currently this feature is a work in progress (WIP) and will not work on ARM architecture
---

#### Create a new application

```shell
$ npm run create
```
##### This will:
- Build applications based on the config.json file.
- New applications are built based on the 'masterTemplateDir' property.
- If an application already exists, nothing will be overwritten.
